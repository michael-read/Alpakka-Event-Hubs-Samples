This repository provides Java based Akka Streams examples of using the Alpakka Azure Event Hubs connector.

> Note: The Alpakka Azure Event Hubs connector is only available to specific licensed Lightbend customers.

## Overview

The Akka Stream samples contained in this repo are based upon the Protobuf based events called UserPurchaseProto. Java classes are automatically generated by the Akka gRPC plugin described [here](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/current/).

Samples Sources, Flows, and Sinks are provided into two classes:  

1. EventHubProducerFlows
2. EventHubConsumerFlows

Simple sample applications have been provided in the app package which ultimately leveage each of the sample Akka Streams.
